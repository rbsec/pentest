# John Scripts
This folder contains various scripts that are useful with John the Ripper.

## [aspnet_membership_to_john.py](aspnet_membership_to_john.py)
Convert ASP.NET Membership hashes into a format that can be cracked with John.

## [format_tester.py](format_tester.py)

Attempt to determine the type of a hash, or how a hash and salt are used together. The script works by attempting to crack a hash (or list of hashes) with a provided wordlist, using every format and subformat that John supports.

This is useful if you have an unknown hash (such as 32 hexadecimal characters), or you have a hash and a salt but aren't sure how they're combined.

It's slower than tools like hashID, which try to guess based on the length and character set - but it's also more reliable.

It will be much faster and more accurate if you have a known password:hash pair.

## [genwordlist.py](genwordlist.py)

Generate a sorted, unique wordlist from an input file.

## [genwordlist-burp.py](genwordlist-burp.py)

Generate a sorted, unique wordlist from an exported Burpsuite site map.

Export an XML site map by going to Target > Site map, right clicking on a node, and then choosing "Save selected items"

This can be useful for quickly creating a targeted wordlist of the organisation when you've already explored their website with Burpsuite (rather than having to spider it again with something like CeWL).
